1. O(1) - constant time (cheap)
2. O(log n) - logarithmic time (can discuss later - most applies to trees or sorted lists)
3. O(n) - linear time - proportional to the number of elements in the data structure
4. O(n^2) - quadratic time - this is bad, scales quadratically with number of items in data structure.  eg. 1000 items would cost you 1000*1000 = 1 million actions
and learning what operation you are doing, and how it maps into those is important

1. Hash maps (also called dictionaries or associative map)
2. Arrays
3. linked list
4. Trees
5. Graphs
